.. rubric:: Others' scripts and programs I like and fanboy about

* Ack_: like *grep* but with good defaults for programmers. Ignores version control and build directories; trivial to customise.

	*If you use Ubuntu,* ``apt install ack-grep`` *and define an* ``alias ack=ack-grep`` *in your shell profile.*

* Fish_, the friendly interactive shell. Has better syntax, great defaults (syntax highlighting!), and better tab-completion (substrings, not just prefixes of filenames). Defining and saving an alias is as simple as this::
  
  		alias s sublime_text
  		funcsave s

  This persists the newly created function ``s`` to ``~/.config/fish/functions/s.fish``, and it will automatically be loaded in all currently-running and future shells! No more manual fiddling around with ``~/.profile``.
